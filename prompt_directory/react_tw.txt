Task: Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, open the chest drawer. Then, pick up the old key from the chest drawer. After picking up the old key, assure that the wooden door is unlocked. Then, ensure that the wooden door is open. After pulling open the wooden door, take a trip east. And then, make sure that the screen door is wide open. After that, make an effort to move east. With that done, attempt to take a trip south. Then, pick-up the carrot from the floor of the garden. And then, attempt to go to the north. If you can succeed at that, make an effort to take a trip west. And then, rest the carrot on the stove. Got that? Good!
Observation: -= Bedroom =-

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A standard one.

You see a refrigerator. You check the price tag that's still affixed to the refrigerator. 100 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You see a counter. The counter is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Look over there! a kitchen island. You wonder idly who left that here. The kitchen island is usual. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a bbq. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a bbq, go to TextWorld. However, the bbq, like an empty bbq, has nothing on it. You can see a patio table. The patio table is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.
